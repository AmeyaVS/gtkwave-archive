3.0.0	01may06	Initial release after promotion from 1.3.86 in order to reduce
		confusion with 2.x series.
		Added user's manual pdf file to distribution in doc/.
		Added vertex and rtlbrowse for sourcecode annotation.
3.0.1	09may06	Automatically add extensions to save filenames in gtkwave.
		Cygwin compile fixes.  Add Cygwin functionality for fork() 
		related ops that do in fact work properly.
3.0.2   09may06 More fixes for full function (except pthreads) in Cygwin.  
		Requires usage of Cygserver if rtlbrowse is to work.
		Fixed fonts for Cygwin to improve readability.  
		The Courier font is very bad looking and blitter mangled under
		cygwin.
3.0.3	29may06	Changed yylineno references in vlex.l in rtlbrowse to 
		my_yylineno as newer versions of flex automatically define 
		this and cause duplicate symbols.
		Saw there were still problems with courier on debian.  Also
		check for misc-fixed on non-cygwin systems just in case.
3.0.4	30may06 Added busy watch (hourglass) for long ops that lock the GUI.
		Fixed replace function in treesearch_gtk2 so it doesn't
		simply replace with the last signal.  (Iterator shouldn't
		be used the way it was.)
3.0.5	08jun06 Reworked tree structure code to handle new tree layout
		such that strings are embedded at the end of struct.  This
		reduces memory usage overall.
		Added in implicit hierarchy split on pipe character in
		symbol names as these only really happen in netlists that
		have escaped identifiers.
		For vzt and lxt2 loaders added block allocation of symbols
		and nodes during init in order to allow denser memory
		allocation as the bookkeeping overhead between allocations
		internal to malloc() is unnecessary as the number of
		elements is known at the outset.  Also removed hashing in
		aet2, lxt, lxt2, vzt as sym[hv] is unused on sorted facs.
		Removed unnecessary strlen() calls after sprintf() in the
		dumpfile loaders as the string length is known from the rc
		of sprintf.
		Fixed T_SCOPE rule in vcd.c as dotted hierarchies would
		throw off the parser as hierarchies themselves are 
		(in practice) never really escaped.
		In tree.c, treenamefix() would recurse more than necessary
		such that some dotted hierarchies would cause an order of
		n squared recursion and as such never complete running
		due to the size of the hierarchy.
		Found non _2 versions of memory allocate/free being used
		in various non-library places.
		Fixed signal aliasing problems in GHW traces that have
		memories or aliased signals in ghw.c.
		Added handling for e8 datatypes and arrays in ghwlib.c
		and ghw.c.
		Updated ghwlib.c and main.c in order to handle gzip or
		bzip2 compressed files.  Extension can be .ghw, .ghw.gz,
		or .ghw.bz2 and the file will be handled properly.  Note
		that as the matchword is consulted, just .ghw can be used
		to specify a gzip or bzip2 file implicitly.
		Added ghwdump and ghwdump.1 to the distribution (from ghdl)
		as it is helpful for debugging ghw file failures.
3.0.6	14jul06	Added "Real" option for data type display as passing around
		real numbers in Verilog across modules needs to be done
		with $realtobits and $bitstoreal.
		Added scripting command flag --script in order to allow 
		autosetup of things that are outside of config file control.
		This also allows doing things such as automated print jobs.
		Added --nowm to remove window manager control on most
		windows the viewer brings up.
		Added --xid to allow turning the viewer into a plug-in for
		calling by foreign applications.  This will allow integration
		of the viewer into a single window for example, with IDEs.
		Added --nomenus to remove menus for the case when used in
		conjunction with --xid and it is desired to create an
		embedded wave viewer applet that cannot initiate file I/O
		on its own.  Note that earlier versions of GTK+ cannot 
		handle menu events properly from a GtkPlug.
		Fixed problem with dead memory allocations for GtkColor 
		structs in color.c as found by Valgrind.
		Moved .odt version of the user's guide into doc/ rather than
		the pdf version as this is a sourcecode distribution so the
		original word processor document should be there.  The .pdf
		will still be up on the homepage on the website.
		Added example script (for use with the -S option) in the
		examples/ directory that prints some waves then exits.
		Found problem with directive-based string embedding in older
		gcc compiler versions.
		GTK+-1.2 doesn't handle GtkPlug.
3.0.7   17jul06 Added support for dualview of waveforms using GtkPlug and
		shared memory IPC through use of the "twinwave" front end.
		Updated documentation to add a section on twinwave.
3.0.8	04aug06	Modified order of flags in twinwave as appending flags
		does not work when longopt isn't used.
		Subscripted GtkItemFactoryEntry menu_items for AIX compile.
		More AIX fixes such as conditional alloca.h usage and
		not including getopt.h.
		Removed unused "bus" element from struct fac.
		Added interactive loading of vcd files with the routines in
		vcd_partial.c.  Added shmidcat to the distribition to test 
		this new interactive loading functionality.
		Added real_parameter vartype (Riviera Aldec 2006.6) in all
		vcd loaders.
3.0.9	10aug06	Fixing compiler warnings across various systems.
		Minor speedup in sigcmp() in bitvec.c for EOS detection.
		Fix in vcd_partial.c loader that crashed on interactive
		loads when blank traces are present in the save file.
3.0.10	13aug06	Found inadvertant 64/32 bit conversion in regex.c that was
		from not including "debug.h" header file.
		Missing headers for gcc-3.2.x and earlier dealing with
		select().
		Converted fgetmalloc() to use vlists in order to cut
		down on the backflips and traversal required for the old
		one character per struct method.
		Added VCD recoder that stores the VCD in memory using a
		new recoding scheme rather than histents.  HistEnt structs
		are created as needed.  The old VCD loader is still used for
		--interactive, or if --legacy is used at the command line.
		Added dynamic zlib compression support to VCD recoder and
		vlist_compression_depth rc variable.  -1 disables, 0-9
		mirror zlib compression depths.
3.0.11	12sep06	Updated documentation to include section on VCD recoding
		strategy and LXT (version 1) file format.
		Removed unnecessary mallocs and functions in vcd_recoder.c.
		Cleanup of all warnings with gcc -pedantic in gcc3
		excluding long long integer constant and string constant
		length warnings.
		Disabled splash screen when loading VCD from stdin.
		Cygwin compile fixes (3.0.10 broke the compile).
3.0.12	19sep06	Updated production rule in verilog.g to handle compiling
		parameterized components in opensparc without dying.
		Integrated a lot of compatibility fixes from Peter O'Gorman.
		Actually use config.h for better compatibility now.
		Check for endianness in vzt read/write if XDRs not available
		rather than assuming windows will byte reverse.
		Fixed single time read in vzt_read.c as it wasn't working
		properly in rtlbrowse.
		Added -f (insert args from file) option to vertex.
3.0.13	06oct06	Updated odt file documentation to make chapter-like page
		breaks.
		Updated lxt2vcd and vzt2vcd to emit proper VCD headers for
		other tools that expect them.
		Added attempt_vecmatch() in bitvec.c to match vectors based
		on numbers inside nets in order to match on vectors inside
		of flattened netlist latches (e.g., top.xyz[0:7]_Z).
		Fixed regex compare on illegal regexs that caused viewer
		crash (e.g., when comparing on a single left bracket or
		any other illegal regex).
3.0.14	17oct06	Fixed vztminer and lxt2miner so not specifying -n actually
		works.  Updated manpages and UM for those executables to
		fix description errors.
		Now can snap cursor to named markers--this was overlooked.
		Changed recoder scheme for single bits slightly in order
		to pack 2 more bits in for 0/1 transitions.  This implies
		that 0..31 timesteps can be encoded in 1 byte for the
		common case.
3.0.15	27oct06	Added getopt_long from GNU project.
		Fixed broken compile under GTK1 for rtlbrowse makefile.
		Now can recoalesce bitblasted vectors in rtlbrowse.
		Updated finalize in vcd recoder to add fake 'x' vch for
		non-aliased facilities.  Normally all facs are initialized,
		but noticed that libvcddump doesn't do this.
3.0.16	13nov06	Patches to remove some compile warnings under Cygwin.
		Changed maxdata linker flag for AIX to allow 3.25GB of
		data segment area for AIX5.3.
		Changed unsigned integer splay comparisons in vzt_write.c
		for a slight speedup.
		Updated configure patch scripts to patch over a "LEX = :"
		glitch for AIX5.3 and also to use gcc in AIX for the pccts
		compile because of xlc incompatibilities with it.
		Fixed bug in draw_hptr_trace_vector_analog() that would
		cause crashes on pure real vectors when zoomed out fully.
		Added dynamic tooltips on current marker values for both
		the left and middle mouse buttons (not tested for Win32 
		yet so disabled there).
		Added preliminary support for changing menu accelerators
		through the rc file with an "accel" statement.
3.0.17	27nov06	Fix in vcd recoder for SystemC which doesn't emit time
		zero in the initial dumpvars.  (would be needed anyway for
		dumpers that for some reason don't as the 1st value
		change collapses into the second)
3.0.18  28nov06	Fix in vcd saver for when units are in seconds: keeps 
		timescale of "ss" being used instead of just "s".
		Locale problem in printing of floating point numbers fixed
		by setting up a local fixer routine in config.h for
		availability across all executables.
		Fix in all vcd loaders to handle "port" (along with other
		keywords) that appear in non-keyword parts of the $VAR
		declaration sequence.
		Fixed long standing LXT bug with integer datatype on 
		trivial LXT files.  (Overflow in lt_buf decoder buffer.)
3.0.19	21dec06	More locale fixing with LC_ALL.
		Added user patches from NIIBE Yutaka to remove requirement
		for the GTK_ENABLE_BROKEN flag in GTK2 compilation.
3.0.20	21jan07	Fixed string/real handling in VCD recoder as it did not
		properly add the right-hand side endcaps which would
		crash pattern search.
		Made vcd recoder more robust to be able to handle 'b'
		value changes for string data as well as wires with
		's' type data (for FlashSim).
		Updated strace.c to allow forward/backward on strings and
		reals.
3.0.21	02feb07	Added support for in/out/inout evcd ports generated by
		dumpports in ModelSim.
		Fixed problem with hierarchy being out of order as 
		treegraft needed to be followed by treesort.  This mostly
		impacted recursive hierarchy imports by only allowing
		two signals to import rather than all of them.  Also there
		was an inconsistency with the signal ordering with VCD vs
		the database formats because of this.
3.0.22	19feb07	Bumped up hash size from 65519 to 500009 entries for VCD
		parsers.  
		Bumped up max VCDID fastindex size to 8M entries.
		Now use gperf for verilog datatypes for some speedup in
		gtkwave vcd loaders.
		create_sorted_table() changed to deallocate long names in
		vcd converters as the names are no longer needed once the
		writer has them.
		Fixed GTK1 makefile in src/ as twinwave had pkg-config
		for GTK2.
		Stray getopt.h include in v2l_analyzer_lxt2.h needed to
		be #ifdef'ed with HAVE_GETOPT_H for Solaris.
		XDR library -lnsl explicitly listed for Solaris.
		PATH_MAX set if not defined in verilog.g for Vertex.
		Regenerated configure for setenv()/unsetenv() presence
		which impacts Solaris (use putenv() instead).
		Regenerated configure to handle auto detect of -lnsl, 
		-lrpc, and -lpthread.
		Added -c to file install in top-level makefile (Solaris).
		Use _LARGEFILE_SOURCE value from configure with linux
		rather than assuming it is always 1 with linux.
		Fix to preproc.c in vertex as it was attempting to parse
		directories.  This works ok under linux with EOF but causes
		problems under AIX.
3.0.23	19mar07	Added corresponding va_end() for all va_start().
		Added optional frequency display between markers, also added
		rc variable of use_frequency_display and menu options to
		support this.
		Placed mainbox for marker text label widgets inside an event
		box as this seems to fix the centering problems with GTK2.
3.0.24	02apr07	Fixed makefile generation so 32bit AIX will use >256MB in
		src/helpers.
		Updated vzt2vcd and lxt2vcd so it handles the zero index of
		bitblasted vectors (from ncsim).
		Updated vzt reader so it can re-coalesce bitblasted vectors
		provided the dumped bits are adjacent/in order.
		Minor bugfixes to vztminer and lxt2miner with respect to
		dumpon/dumpoff (don't emit $dumpon/$dumpoff strings as
		that code was leftover from the vzt2vcd).
		Updated manpages for vzt2vcd, lxt2vcd, and vztminer.
		On concatenated vector loads ('#'/':' in savefile), attempts
		to do a load of a monolithic vector on fail.  This is 
		somewhat related to the re-coalesce vectors feature above.
		Implemented reverse of this for monolithic vectors into
		the '#' bitstrand variants.
3.0.25	10apr07	System Verilog with MTI fix for VCD declarations of form 
		$var reg 64 >w #implicit-var###VarElem:ram_di[0.0] [63:0] $end
		...debussy implicitly escapes the varname during loading so 
		gtkwave does it too now for all VCD loaders.
		More System Verilog with MTI fixes: VCD (parameter) vars of 
		length zero are representative of reals with MTI: they don't
		use real_parameter like Riviera does.
		Updated vcd_saver.c to handle saving these implicit-var
		facilities correctly.  Likewise updated lxt-write.c,
		lxt2_write.c, and vzt_write.c to handle correct bracket
		stripping for the [0.0] semantics.
		Modified dynamic resize routine so large escaped names don't
		cause issues with the signal window crowding out the
		wave window.
3.0.26	18apr07	Fixed various compiler warnings discovered from looking at
		Fedora Core compile logs and later compiling against
		Centos/RHEL5.
		Commented out GTK_CAN_FOCUS for scollbars in wavewindow
		as it was causing rendering problems with newer versions
		of GTK.
3.0.27	27apr07	Renamed vertex to vermin to avoid name clashes with
		existing 3D "vertex" package on debian systems.
		Reverted back to using Open Office 2 Beta rather than
		Open Office 2 as it was causing .odt docs corruption.
3.0.28	30apr07	Changed anonymous union in struct Node as it is a
		gcc extension.
		Fixed some vcd parser memory leaks found by Valgrind.
		Moved errno check in vcd parser as it seems that
		the GTK event loop called in splash_sync() calls it
		on gnome 2.18 for some reason (reported by Gentoo
		gtkwave package maintainer).
3.0.29	27may07	Added viewer support for arrays (currently AE2 only).
